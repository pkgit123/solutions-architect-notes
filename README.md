Notes on Solutions Architect

### Patterns:
* Communications style as explanatory and curious (Phil Tetlock)
* Understands technical trade-offs about customer requirements and technology capabilities
* Invest time and money where fixed problems stay fixed in the future

### Anti-Patterns:
* Communications style as confirmatory (Phil Tetlock)
* Communications style as accusatory (constantly challenge others)
* Communications style as "player-hater" (minimize and criticize other people, brag about self)
* Favor saving money now, without considering future cost increase and without considering negative customer impact
* Not able to understand technical details (who, what, when, where, how, why)
* Solutions as one-size-fits-all without curious about customer requirements
* Spend 100% of time improving legacy architecture, spend 0% of time exploring new technology solutions
